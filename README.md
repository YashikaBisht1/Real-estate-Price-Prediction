# House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. Below is an overview of the project:

## Skills and Technologies Used
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains datasets used in the project.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model deployment.
- **Results**: Visualization of model performance metrics.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git`
2. Install necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Results
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting house prices.
- Visualization of key insights and findings from the data analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional features for improved predictions.
